Topics: Evolutionary Algorithms
Professor: Dr.Mark Hatcher http://www.cs.mun.ca/~mhatcher/

A special thanks to Dr.Hatcher for implementing a fun and great way to learn path searching methods. And also for giving me permission to share my experience with these assignments. Unfortunaltely, to avoid future students using my code in the class I am unable to show the code. If you have any questions let me know at klan@mun.ca! To play with the program, the tester file can be modified

How to run the program

Open console (terminal, command.exe, etc)

Navigate to inside the Lights Out folder

Compile the code:

javac *.java

Run the code:

java AntTester
